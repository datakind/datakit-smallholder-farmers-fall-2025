🌾 Kenya Climate–WeFarm Analysis
DataKind DataKit – Challenge 1: Climate & Agriculture

This project explores how rainfall and temperature patterns in Kenya influence the types of agricultural questions farmers ask on the WeFarm platform.
The analysis aims to help Producers Direct understand weather-driven farming behaviors and improve support for smallholder farmers.

📊 Key Findings
🌧️ Pest & planting questions spike following heavy rainfall.
☀️ Irrigation & soil questions increase during hot, dry months.
🧠 Using LDA Topic Modeling, we detected clear seasonal shifts in conversation topics.
